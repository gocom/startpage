Install
-----

### Download a web extension

Download a packaged web extension from [releases](https://github.com/gocom/startpage/releases)
or [build artifacts](https://github.com/gocom/startpage/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)
and load it in your web browser.

There are currently no releases in any extension marketplaces; Chrome Web Store
and the like.

### Build Locally from source

Clone the repository and build:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gocom/startpage.git
$ make build
```

The created `build` directory can then be loaded as a development web extension in your web browser.
